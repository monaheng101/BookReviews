# BookReviews

Book Review is a blog *design* where authors write summaries about books they have read. The blog posts can be viewed all together or by genres.

## What I have learned:

1. Organizing content with grids
2. Use of font awesome icons
3. Use of a google font
4. Use of coolors.co for colour schemes
5. Responsive blog design
